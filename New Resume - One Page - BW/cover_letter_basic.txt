Dear Madam / Sir,

I would like to apply for a summer internship position with <Company_Name>. I learned of your company through the placement center at North Carolina State University.

I am currently majoring in Computer Science at the University of Missouri and have completed one Semester. While I have a comprehensive Computer Science background, my emphasis is on Software Development, particularly Java based environments. I feel that your firm places prominence in similar areas and having the privilege of serving as an intern with you will give me that further exposure I need to advance my career.

Upon graduating, I hope to establish myself as a 10x Software Engineering. With the right opportunities and experience to cutting edge projects and platforms, I believe I can achieve this goal. I hope that your firm will be an important period in my growth towards achieving my aspirations.

I've previously worked full time at Deloitte Consulting LLP. While there, I worked on numerous teams and gained valuable skills and experience that I believe give me an edge above my peers. Besides this, my mentors have guided me towards working on numerous side projects. These projects have helped me develop technical and organizational skills that would be invaluable for any intern to have. I found some of these skills, if not all, are embedded in the core values of <Company_Name>.

I would like the opportunity to converse with you to discuss any internship opportunities you might have. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to know more about my projects / work experience. You can reach me by phone at (984) 215-8067 or by email at vicky.p.katara@gmail.com .

Thank you for your consideration. 

Warm Regards,

Vicky Katara
